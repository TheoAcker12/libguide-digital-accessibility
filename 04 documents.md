# Documents

## PDFs

PDF is an extremely common file format. Unfortunately, these documents are extremely difficult to make accessible.

1.  If you are using a PDF only to format content to be printed, you don't need to worry about the digital accessibility of the PDF, though you may want to have an accessible file available in case anyone cannot use the printed version.
2.  Consider providing a webpage and/or non-PDF document with equivalent content along with or instead of a PDF. These are much easier to make accessible.

If you must provide a PDF, and only a PDF, you may want to take this [Linked In Learning course for Creating Accessible PDFs](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/creating-accessible-pdfs/welcome?u=2150050) or send the PDF to a remediation service (this may get expensive).

## Other Documents

In general, creating accessible documents relies on the accessibility principles discussed elsewhere in this guide, but implementing these principles may vary based on the document type and editor. A few resources for various document types are provided below.
